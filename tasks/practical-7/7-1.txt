Equation: FFN(x) = max(0, x * W1 + b1) * W2 + b2

The pointwise feed-forward layer is a non-linear transformation layer. It allows the model to
capture and process complex information and relations at each position independently.
Therefore it is an key element in various sequence to sequence tasks. So the goal is to
avoid internal covariate shifts.
